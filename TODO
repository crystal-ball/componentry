# TODO

- The useActive hook passes everything through which needs to be cleaned (eg guid in
  Alert)
- Dropdown: Default focus on open first item
- Dropdown: Keydown listener for arrows to navigate through menu items
- Come up with a term for Active components with multiple elements instead of multi-active
- Come up with a term for elements with wrappers around content instead of `popper`
- Change `btnStyles` to `btnClasses`
- Change `defaultAnchor to anchorDefault
- Change defaultDirection to directionDefault
- Why was `activeId` default to an empty string?
- Check body overflow on render and adjust width if needed in Tooltip and Popover
- Better names for all Tab related components
- Rename `tabs-panes-pane` to `tab-content`
- Document setting up spacing styles that change by breakpoint, eg greater padding in
  large screens than small screens

## Classes for factories

By default a className is assigned to each generated component in the active component
factories using the passed name. For components that need a different `baseClass`, it can
be passed explicitly. Similarly a `baseName` can be passed to override the default
component name used to look up theme values.
