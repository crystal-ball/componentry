# TODO

- ⭐️ `variant` and `baseClass` -> Is it possible to separate the functionality CSS of
  active components into the baseClass, and include all of the styles in the `variant`
  class? This would enable switching the variant without having to rewrite show/hide
  CSS...

  🎉 `variant` should control the default class passed to component that has styles
  attached to it. Components should also include a set of behavior classes that have
  visibility and transitions attached, eg `dropdown-behaviors`,
  `dropdown-content-behaviors`

- Document that classNames are additive, they don't override. SHOULD THAT BE THE CASE???
- Dropdown: Default focus on open first item
- Dropdown: Keydown listener for arrows to navigate through menu items
- Come up with a term for elements with wrappers around content instead of `popper`
- Check body overflow on render and adjust width if needed in Tooltip and Popover
- Better names for all Tab related components
- Rename `tabs-panes-pane` to `tab-content`
- Document setting up spacing styles that change by breakpoint, eg greater padding in
  large screens than small screens
- Are border<DIRECTION> props working??

## Inconsistencies for the future

- Background, bg, foreground, color... The classes, props and Sass variables for working
  with background and foreground colors are inconsistent.
- ?Add a `borderRadius` prop with sizes and passthrough values?
