# TODO

- ⭐️ `variant` and `baseClass` -> Is it possible to separate the functionality CSS of
  active components into the baseClass, and include all of the styles in the `variant`
  class? This would enable switching the variant without having to rewrite show/hide
  CSS...
- Document that classNames are additive, they don't override. SHOULD THAT BE THE CASE???
- Dropdown: Default focus on open first item
- Dropdown: Keydown listener for arrows to navigate through menu items
- Come up with a term for elements with wrappers around content instead of `popper`
- Check body overflow on render and adjust width if needed in Tooltip and Popover
- Better names for all Tab related components
- Rename `tabs-panes-pane` to `tab-content`
- Document setting up spacing styles that change by breakpoint, eg greater padding in
  large screens than small screens
- Are border<DIRECTION> props working??

## Classes for factories

By default a className is assigned to each generated component in the active component
factories using the passed name. For components that need a different `baseClass`, it can
be passed explicitly. Similarly a `baseName` can be passed to override the default
component name used to look up theme values.
