# Publishing notes

### Babel compilation

Source code is compiled using `preset-env` to ensure that any modern syntax is compiled to
browserslist `"defaults"` option, this should ensure the library can be included in any
application without having to be compiled.

#### Polyfills

No language features are polyfilled, this seems to match the setup of most other packages.
On the plus side this means no unnecessary polyfills are included in the final
distribution. On the cons side it means users must ensure their applications polyfills for
browser (instead of polyfills for just application use).

### Types

Type declaration files are output in `/types` instead of `/dist` so that module
augmentation paths are more intuitive, eg:

`declare module 'componentry/types/components/Text/Text'`

vs =>

`declare module 'componentry/dist/browser/components/Text/Text'`
