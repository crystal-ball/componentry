## Componentry V4

_V4 should be focused on solidifying consistent patterns and optimizing DX_

### Flex

- Add System props for `flex-grow`, and `flex-shrink`.

### Icons

- Add a size prop similar to the Button size prop. It's likely that `font`
  variants will always want to use 1em sizing, but `feature` variants would
  benefit from having a predefined set of sizes, with `width` and `height` prop
  overrides.

### DX

- Add ability to customize which classes are prefixed, eg it would be nice to
  prefix the base classes, but no the variant classes.
