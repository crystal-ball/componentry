## Componentry V4

_V4 should be focused on solidifying consistent patterns and optimizing DX_

### Icons

- Add a size prop similar to the Button size prop. It's likely that `font`
  variants will always want to use 1em sizing, but `feature` variants would
  benefit from having a predefined set of sizes, with `width` and `height` prop
  overrides.

### DX

- Add ability to customize which classes are prefixed, eg it would be nice to
  prefix the base classes, but not the variant classes.

## Utility classes

Long term Componentry doesn't need to own utility classes, there are other great
libraries out there for that (Tailwind). Explore using Tailwind for utility
classes like display and spacing and removing the utils styles.
