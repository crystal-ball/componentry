# Icon

## Variants

Componentry ships with a single `font` variant which creates font icons:

<Story name='Icon'>
  <Icon id='coffee' />
</Story>

## Icon alignment

Icons are center aligned in flex and text contexts by default for convenience:

In flex containers icons are centered with `self-align: center`:

<h1 className='flex gap-0.5'>
  <Icon id='code' />
  Flex alignment
</h1>

<h2 className='flex gap-0.5'>
  <Icon id='code' />
  Flex alignment
</h2>

<h3 className='flex gap-0.5'>
  <Icon id='code' />
  Flex alignment
</h3>

In text elements icons are centered with `vertical-align: -0.15em`:

<h1>
  <Icon id='code' /> Flex alignment
</h1>

<h2>
  <Icon id='code' /> Flex alignment
</h2>

<h3>
  <Icon id='code' /> Flex alignment
</h3>

Checkmate... Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my
chance <Icon id="code" matchTextBaseline />.They're using our own satellites against us.
And the clock is ticking. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! I was part of something
special. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.
