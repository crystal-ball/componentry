# Icon

## Variants

Componentry ships with a single `font` variant which creates font icons:

<Story name='Icon'>
  <Icon id='coffee' />
</Story>

## Icon alignment

Center icons by wrapping them in a flex container.

<h1 className='flex gap-0.5'>
  <Icon id='code' />
  Flex alignment
</h1>

<h2 className='flex gap-0.5'>
  <Icon id='code' />
  Flex alignment
</h2>

<h3 className='flex gap-0.5'>
  <Icon id='code' />
  Flex alignment
</h3>

## Font baseline adjustment

Checkmate... Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my
chance <Icon id="coffee" baseline />.They're using our own satellites against us. And the
clock is ticking. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! I was part of something special.
Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.
