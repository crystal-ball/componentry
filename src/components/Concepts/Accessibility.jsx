      When creating interactable elements, using the correct HTML elements provides
      better default accessibility attributes. The <code>&lt;Button /&gt;</code>{' '}
      component can be configured to appear and behave the same as an anchor element

      has user interaction is important because button elements include important
      accessibility traits by default, such as keyboard operation.{' '}
