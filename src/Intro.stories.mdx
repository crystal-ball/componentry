### Library conventions

_This story has examples of the core library component APIs and conventions._

### Terms

- Action: an operating mechanism, or the manner in which a mechanism or instrument
  operates. Use with components that have elements which cause a change of state when
  triggered.

### Render as

_All components accept an `as` prop that will override the container element passed to
`React.createElement`. This can be useful for customizing how a component is rendered or
layering additional logic onto a component instance._

This override layers on a conditional loading display, note that passing all of the props
to the button element in LoadingButton is required

### Class names

_Class names for each component are layered together from the theme context, JSX props,
component computed class names and library computed class names._

<Theme
  theme={{
    Button: {
      themeClassName: 'context-class',
    },
  }}
>
  <Button className='jsx-prop-class' color='primary' uppercase>
    ClassNames Button
  </Button>
</Theme>
