TODO:
- SimpleElement: baseClasses => baseClassName
- Use oneOf wherever possible
- Shared template for State components (see Drawer render)
- Make hidden default true for Content
- Rename `type` to `element`
- Rename `state`
- Figure out if `dropdown` can use the same class format as other elements?
- Use withState with modal?
